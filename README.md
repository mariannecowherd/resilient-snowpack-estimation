# resilient-snowpack-estimation code

## code
The code folder contains python scripts and jupyter notebooks required to reproduce the analysis and figures. Main figure visualizations are labeled with the figure number and extended data figures are labeled as "ext." Other codes are labeled sequentially and with a descriptive phrase.

## data
The data folder contains some of the data required to reproduce the analysis and figures, including geospatial products which are available online. The actual downscaled GCM solutions are archived and available for download at [link to Rahim paper] with full explanation of their generation and structure in Rahimi et al., 202X. Intermediate reduced data products are generated from scripts in the `code` folder to streamline plotting and analysis and are referenced in `code/tmp/[filename]` in this repository. 

## figures
Saved full figures as in the paper
